# Semester Project 2

To create an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections. The client facing system must be responsive and the website will be populated by a Strapi API which you will deploy to heroku.

## Brief

You are to build an e-commerce website. You can choose the theme of your website. It should follow the site architecture described below.

Design your website using your favourite tool. You will need to find a suitable logo. If you decide to create a logo yourself, do not spend too much time on it.

You must apply all that you have learned in your studies so far. The site must have a good user experience and UI design, following today’s trends and design patterns.

Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.

Build admin pages to create, update and delete products.

The website must be responsive on all devices.

Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of the project.

**You will create and deploy your own version of strapi to heroku**

## Level 1 Process

**Customer-facing pages**

**Home page**

The home page must include:

- A hero banner with an image that is uploaded to Strapi. You can find this in the Home single type in the provided Strapi project.
- A list of featured products. On Strapi products can be marked as ‘featured’. When a product is marked as ‘featured’ it should be displayed on the homepage. You can find the products in the Products collection type.

**Products page**

The products page must include:

- A list of all products added to Strapi. Each product must display its title, price and image. The product should link to its products detail page.
- A search text box. When searching (filtering), only the products that include the searched text in their title or description should be listed.

**Product details page**

This page is reached by a user clicking on a product on the product list page. The product details page must include:

- title
- description
- image
- price
- an add to cart button. This will toggle the product in and out of a cart array stored in local storage.

**Cart/Basket page**

The cart/basket page must display a list of all products added to the cart. Load the items that have been added to local storage and display them on the page. If the cart is empty display a message indicating this.

Each product in the cart must display:

- title
- price
- a link to the product view page
- image
- After the list of products, display the total price of all the products in the cart.

Note: the cart page is not a checkout page. No payments or user details are required to be taken.

**Admin section**
The admin section (apart from the log in form) must only be accessible to logged in admin users and must include the following features.

**Login/Logout**
Create an admin login form that allows administrator users to login. Use local storage to keep the user logged in.

When logged in, display a logout button in the layout that logs the user out. Logging out should not clear the cart.

**Add/edit products**

Create form(s) that allow products to be added and edited. The form must allow the user to toggle whether a product is featured.

**Product images**

Use a text input that allows a URL to be entered. This allows an image from an external URL to be used as the product image. For a hack save images in github.
You can find the fields for each in Strapi. Use only one to display a product image.

Allow products to be deleted. Before a product is deleted you must display a confirmation dialog. The product should only be deleted if the user confirms.

## FAQ

- You can use CSS libraries like Bootstrap.
- Use Sass for your styles. Using BEM is optional but using proper class names is important.
- Use vanilla (regular) JavaScript for the project and split your code up using modules (imports/exports).
- You can use small JS libraries to perform tasks such as formatting dates with Moment.js

## Marking criteria

- All functionality should be implemented.
- The design should be coherent and provide a good user experience.
- All the customer-facing pages must be fully responsive.
- Use appropriate names for Sass classes and folders. -All code should be properly formatted and arranged with sensible variable and function names. - Use modules (imports/exports) to organise your code.

## Rules

Copying and sharing of any code will result in your project being failed.
