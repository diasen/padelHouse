To create an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections. The client facing system must be responsive and the website will be populated by a Strapi API which you will deploy to heroku.

## Description

You are to build an e-commerce website. You can choose the theme of your website. It should follow the site architecture described below.

You must apply all that you have learned in your studies so far. The site must have a good user experience and UI design, following todayâ€™s trends and design patterns.

Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.

Build admin pages to create, update and delete products.

The website must be responsive on all devices.

Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of the project.
